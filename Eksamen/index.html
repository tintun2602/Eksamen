      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <p>
        Persons with disabilities, especially those living in developing
        countries, encounter challenges in access to water, sanitation and
        hygiene, including physical, institutional, social and attitudinal
        barriers. This is particularly true for persons with severe
        disabilities. Furthermore, in many countries persons with disabilities
        are less likely to live in households with access to improved water and
        sanitation, and less likely to live in a dwelling with hygiene and
        sanitation facilities on the premises. This can create difficulties for
        persons with disabilities who experience difficulties in mobility, in
        locating the bathroom and in waiting in line. Lack of accessibility of
        toilets outside the home is also a challenge and prevents persons with
        disabilities from participating in society. Crowdsourced data, mostly
        from developed countries, indicates that only 69 per cent of public
        toilets are accessible for wheelchair users. In Australia, for instance,
        many public toilets have been assessed as accessible for wheelchair
        users (Figure 2). Crowdsourced data in developing countries is scarce,
        but the available data suggest that most public toilets are not
        accessible for wheelchair users, as illustrated in Figure 3 in the south
        region of Malawi. Evidence also suggests that many primary schools do
        not have sanitation facilities that are accessible by persons with
        reduced mobility. Assistive technologies, such as specially designed
        handles for water pumps or toilets, ramps and handrails, and wider doors
        that are designed for persons with disabilities, have been used to
        overcome such challenges and make water, sanitation and hygiene
        accessible. Some countries have also made communal wells safe and
        physically accessible for persons with disabilities and have provided
        moveable toilet seats to households with latrines, which have helped
        persons with disabilities and leg and/or back problems by reducing the
        need to sit or crawl on a wet latrine floor.
